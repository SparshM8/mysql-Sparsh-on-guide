    "## Lab Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Outstanding! You have successfully completed the Basic CRUD Operations Lab. In this lab, you mastered the fundamental database operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **CREATE (INSERT)**: Added multiple records efficiently using executemany()\n",
    "2. **READ (SELECT)**: Queried data with various conditions and sorting\n",
    "3. **UPDATE**: Modified existing records safely\n",
    "4. **DELETE**: Removed records with proper WHERE conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts Learned\n",
    "- **INSERT syntax**: Single and multiple record insertion\n",
    "- **SELECT variations**: Basic queries, WHERE conditions, ORDER BY\n",
    "- **UPDATE with WHERE**: Safe modification of specific records\n",
    "- **DELETE with WHERE**: Controlled record removal\n",
    "- **Connection management**: Proper cursor and connection handling\n",
    "- **Data integrity**: Understanding the impact of operations\n",
    "\n",
    "## SQL Best Practices\n",
    "- Always use WHERE clauses for UPDATE and DELETE\n",
    "- Test queries on development data first\n",
    "- Use transactions for related operations\n",
    "- Close connections when done\n",
    "- Handle errors gracefully\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanced Topics to Explore\n",
    "- JOIN operations for multiple tables\n",
    "- Aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG)\n",
    "- Subqueries and complex conditions\n",
    "- Indexing for performance\n",
    "- Stored procedures and triggers\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "- Continue with advanced MySQL topics\n",
    "- Build a complete application with database backend\n",
    "- Learn about database design and normalization\n",
    "- Explore MySQL administration and optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Exercise\n",
    "Create a complete book management system:\n",
    "1. Design tables for books, authors, and categories\n",
    "2. Insert sample data for each table\n",
    "3. Write queries to:\n",
    "   - Find all books by a specific author\n",
    "   - Update book prices\n",
    "   - Delete books published before a certain year\n",
    "   - Generate reports on book inventory\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to always backup your data and test operations carefully!"
