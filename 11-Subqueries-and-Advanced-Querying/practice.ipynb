    "Congratulations! You've completed Lab 11: Subqueries and Advanced Querying.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Learned:\n",
    "- **Single-row subqueries**: Return one value (=, <, >)\n",
    "- **Multiple-row subqueries**: Return multiple values (IN, ANY, ALL)\n",
    "- **Correlated subqueries**: Reference outer query columns\n",
    "- **Derived tables**: Subqueries in FROM clause\n",
    "- **GROUP BY**: Group identical data for aggregation\n",
    "- **HAVING**: Filter groups after aggregation\n",
    "- **ROLLUP**: Create subtotals and grand totals\n",
    "- **EXISTS/NOT EXISTS**: Check for record existence\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "1. **WHERE** filters rows before grouping, **HAVING** filters groups after\n",
    "2. Correlated subqueries execute once per outer row (consider performance)\n",
    "3. Use appropriate subquery type for your data requirements\n",
    "4. ROLLUP creates hierarchical summary reports\n",
    "5. EXISTS is often faster than IN for existence checks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "- Practice with larger datasets\n",
    "- Learn Common Table Expressions (CTEs)\n",
    "- Explore window functions\n",
    "- Study query optimization\n",
    "- Consider stored procedures for complex logic\n",
